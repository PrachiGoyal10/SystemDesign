- Kafka is a distributed system that allows multiple services to communicate with each other via its queue based architecture
Event streaming plarform used to collect, store and process real time data streams at scale.

- Broker: A computer, instance or container running the kafka process is call broker. Multiple brokers would form a Kafka cluster.
It is responsible for the communication between multiple service (handle write and read request,manage replication of partitions )

- Event: An event in KAfka is modeled as key/value pair.
The messages that are produced to or consumed from the Kafka broker are called events. These messages are stored in the form of bytes in the broker’s disk storage.

- Topic: a storage unit where all the messages sent by the producer are stored.
generally,  similar data is stored in individual topics.


- Partitions: A topic can be further subdivided into multiple storage units and these subdivisions of a topic are known as partitions.
By default, a topic is created with only 1 partition and whatever messages are published to this topic are stored in that partition.
If you configure a topic to have multiple partitions then the messages sent by the producers would be stored in these partitions such that no two partitions would have the same message/event.
All the partitions in a topic would also have their own offsets.


- Consumer Groups
A bunch of consumers can form a group in order to cooperate and consume messages from a set of topics.
If two consumers have subscribed to the same topic and are present in the same consumer group, then these two consumers would be assigned a different set of partitions and none of these two consumers would receive the same messages.
Kafka maintains that no two partitions can be assigned to the consumer in a consumer group


- Same vs Different Consumer Groups 
-> multiple consumers in the same consumer group:
    Higher throughput or increase the consumption rate for a particular topic.
    Have at max consumers equal to the number of partitions of a topic in a consumer group
    Message consumption would be happening in parallel, thereby increasing the consumption rate.

-> multiple consumer groups subscribed to the topic
    When we want multiple consumers to consume the same messages of a topic


->  rebalancing in Kafka
Rebalancing is the re-assignment of partition ownership among consumers within a given consumer group such that every consumer in a consumer group is assigned one or more partitions.

When??
A new consumer joins the consumer group
An existing consumer goes down.
New partitions are added
An existing consumer is considered dead by the Group coordinator
A Group coordinator is a kafka broker which receives heartbeats from all consumers of a consumer group. Every consumer group has a group coordinator.



->  Replication :
- Partition data is copied to other brokers for Fault tolerance
- 1 Leader (main replica) has N-1 Followers (copies)
- Read and write happens to the leader
- If one node of the cluster dies, another will take over the role.
- a replication factor is created for the topics contained in any particular broker.
- A replication factor is the number of copies of data over multiple brokers. The replication factor value should be greater than 1 always (between 2 or 3). This helps to store a replica of the data in another broker from where the user can access it.
- The followers(brokers) will be allowed to synchronize the data. But, in the presence of a leader, none of the followers is allowed to serve the client's request. These replicas are known as ISR(in-sync-replica). So, Apache Kafka offers multiple ISR(in-sync-replica) for the data.


-> Replication Factor: 
- The replication factor of a topic decides how many replicas of a partition in that topic should be maintained by the Kafka cluster. 
- A topic with partition as 1 and replication factor as 2 would mean that two copies of the same partition with same data would be stored in the Kafka cluster.


-> Retention Period: The messages stored in Kafka are not deleted once consumed, but are deleted by either of the below approaches:
- time based retention: Messages are deleted only after a certain time period is reached.
- Size based retention: When a max message size for a partition is reached 

-> Schema Registry
As the business grows, the kafka message format may change like adding some new field etc
- Schema registry is external to kafka brokers.
- maintains a database of schemas
- this db is perisested in internal kafka topic 
- kind of producer / consumer api 
- Defines schema compatibility rules per topic.
- Producer API prevents incomatible msgs being produced.
- Consumer  API prevents incomatible msgs being consumed.
