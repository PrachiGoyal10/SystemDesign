Cassandra Write Path Overview
Write-Ahead Log (WAL):

Also called the Commit Log in Cassandra.
Ensures durability by writing incoming data to disk before it's written elsewhere.
If Cassandra crashes, the Commit Log can be replayed to recover data.
MemTable:

An in-memory, sorted data structure where recent writes are stored.
Each table in Cassandra has its own MemTable.
Data is stored here temporarily and can be queried immediately.
SSTable (Sorted String Table):

When the MemTable reaches a specified size, it is flushed to disk as an immutable SSTable.
SSTables are optimized for reads and serve as the permanent storage format in Cassandra.
Detailed Write Path in Cassandra
Step 1: Incoming Write

A client sends a write request.
The data is written to:
The Commit Log (for durability).
The MemTable (for fast access).
Step 2: MemTable Operations

The MemTable is a sorted structure (like a binary tree or AVL tree).
Writes are added to the MemTable in sorted order, which makes it efficient for subsequent merges with SSTables.
Step 3: Flushing

When the MemTable reaches its maximum size (defined by the memtable_heap_space_in_mb setting), it is flushed to disk as an SSTable.
A new MemTable is created to continue processing writes.
Step 4: Compaction

Periodically, Cassandra merges and compacts SSTables to reduce fragmentation and improve query performance.
Advantages of MemTables in Cassandra
Write Efficiency:
Batches writes in memory before flushing them to disk, reducing disk I/O overhead.
Sorted Data:
Keeps data in a sorted structure, simplifying the merge process with SSTables.
Durability:
The Commit Log ensures no data is lost if a crash occurs before flushing.
MemTable Settings in Cassandra
You can tune MemTable settings in Cassandra's configuration file (cassandra.yaml) to optimize performance:

Memory Allocation:

memtable_heap_space_in_mb: Total memory allocated for MemTables.
memtable_offheap_space_in_mb: Specifies off-heap memory allocation for MemTables (optional).
Flushing Behavior:

memtable_cleanup_threshold: Determines when to trigger a flush based on memory usage.
memtable_flush_writers: Controls the number of threads that flush MemTables to SSTables.
